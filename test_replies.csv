1235101990666919936,gustasticgus,False,35,"Q. What is a CoronaVirus?
A: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. 
#coronavirus #coronavirusindia",coronavirus,1235105420252856321
1235104088724930560,gustasticgus,False,35,"Q. What is COVID-19?
A. COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.",,1235105420252856321
1235106079446454272,gustasticgus,False,35,"Q. How fatal is COVID-19?
A. [1/3 ]Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.",,1235105420252856321
1235106084789993473,gustasticgus,False,35,"[2/3] Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. About 2% of people with the disease have died. #CoronavirusOutbreak #coronavirusindia",CoronavirusOutbreak,1235105420252856321
1235107458449698816,gustasticgus,False,35,"Q. How does COVID-19 spreads?
A. [1/3] People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. #CoronaVirusUpdates",CoronaVirusUpdates,1235105420252856321

1235107466695720960,gustasticgus,False,35,[3/3] People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. #coronavirusindia,coronavirusindia,1235105420252856321
1235108598599966720,gustasticgus,False,35,"Q. Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?
A. Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  #coronavirus #coronovirusindia",coronavirus,1235105420252856321
1235110548632567808,gustasticgus,False,35,"Q. Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?
A. [1/2] The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. But many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms in the early stages.",,1235105420252856321
