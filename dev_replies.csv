Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.

Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
